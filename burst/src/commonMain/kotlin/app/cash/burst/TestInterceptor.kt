/**
 * Intercepts the execution of a test function, including its `@BeforeTest` and `@AfterTest`
 * functions.
 *
 * This sample creates a directory before a test runs and deletes it after.
 *
 * ```
 * class TemporaryDirectory : TestInterceptor {
 *   lateinit var path: Path
 *     private set
 *
 *   override fun intercept(testFunction: TestFunction) {
 *     path = createTemporaryDirectory(testFunction)

 *
 * Adopt an interceptor in your test by declaring a property of this type (or any subtype) and
 * annotating it `@InterceptTest`:
 *
 * ```
 * class DocumentStorageTest {
 *   @InterceptTest
 *   val temporaryDirectory = TemporaryDirectory()
 *
 *   @Test
 *   fun happyPath() {
 *     val original = SampleData.document

 *     val decoded = DocumentReader().read(temporaryDirectory.path)
 *     assertThat(decoded).isEqualTo(original)
