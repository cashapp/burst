/**
 * This is a ✨ magic ✨ function that Burst will expand during compilation into specializations.
 * Use it in as a parameter's default value when declaring a test function:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @Test
 * fun drinkSoda(volume: Int = burstValues(12, 16, 24)) {
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This function has many limitations:
 *
 *  * It must only be used to declare the default value of a parameter.
 *  * Its arguments must be literal values or uses of named declarations.
