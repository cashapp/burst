Burst
=====

Burst is a unit testing library that uses enums to parameterize unit tests.

It is similar to [TestParameterInjector] in usage, but Burst is implemented as a Kotlin compiler
plug-in. Burst supports all Kotlin platforms and works great in multiplatform projects.


Usage
-----

Define an enum for the property you wish to vary.

```kotlin
enum class Soda {
  Pepsi, Coke
}
```

The enum can be simple as above, or contain data and methods specific to what you are testing.

```kotlin
enum class Collections {
  MutableSetOf {
    override fun <T> create(): MutableCollection<T> {
      return mutableSetOf()
    }
  },
  MutableListOf {
    override fun <T> create(): MutableCollection<T> {
      return mutableListOf()
    }
  },
  NewArrayDeque {
    override fun <T> create(): MutableCollection<T> {
      return ArrayDeque()
    }
  };

  abstract fun <T> create(): MutableCollection<T>?
}
```

Annotate your test class with `@Burst`, and accept an enum as a constructor parameter:

```kotlin
@Burst
class DrinkSodaTest(
  val soda: Soda = Soda.Pepsi,
) {
  ...
}
```

Burst will specialize the test class for each value in the enum. If you specified a default value
for the parameter, it'll be used when you run the test in the IDE.

Burst can also specialize individual test functions:

```kotlin
@Test
fun drinkFavoriteSodas(soda: Soda = Soda.Pepsi) {
  ...
}
```

Use multiple enums for the combination of their variations.

```kotlin
@Test
fun collectSodas(
  soda: Soda = Soda.Pepsi,
  collectionsFactory: CollectionFactory = CollectionFactory.MutableSetOf,
) {
  ...
}
```

The test will be specialized for each combination of arguments.

 * `collectSodas(Soda.Pepsi, CollectionFactory.MutableSetOf)`
 * `collectSodas(Soda.Pepsi, CollectionFactory.MutableListOf)`
 * `collectSodas(Soda.Pepsi, CollectionFactory.NewArrayDeque)`
 * `collectSodas(Soda.Coke, CollectionFactory.MutableSetOf)`
 * `collectSodas(Soda.Coke, CollectionFactory.MutableListOf)`
 * `collectSodas(Soda.Coke, CollectionFactory.NewArrayDeque)`

Gradle Setup
------------

Add Burst to your root project's buildscript dependencies:

```kotlin
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath("app.cash.burst:burst-gradle-plugin:0.5.0")
  }
}
```

Then add the plugin to a module's `build.gradle`:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("app.cash.burst")
  ...
}
```
